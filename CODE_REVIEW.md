# Rules

- Make sure PR Checklist checked
- Follow semantic commit message.
- Aim for at least 2 approvals (depending on team size).
- Resolve all conversations by having the reviewer mark them as resolved, not the PR author.
- Ensure that all checks have passed before merging.
- Label the PR with "please update" if there are any comments, and remove the label once they have been addressed.
- Notify reviewers after addressing comments and fixes to keep them updated.
- Each pull request (PR) should consist of multiple commits to break down the work performed. However, these commits should be squashed and merged into the main branch and associated with a unique Clickup/JIRA ID.
- When possible, break down tasks into subtasks to avoid having too many changes in one PR.
